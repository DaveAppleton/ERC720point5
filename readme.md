# ERC720point5


A problem with ticketing is sometimes large tranches of tickets are sold together.

While the tickets are pretty much identical, they may have some identifying features and should be able to be diffentiated from each other, for example to show that a ticket holder had been admitted.

This is a bare bones demonstration of being able to mint thousands of tokens if necessary and to transfer individual tokens.

It could be extended to transfer blocks of tokens.

The full ERC721 spec has not been implemented (yet)

This was a quick hack and may have loads of bugs in it.
